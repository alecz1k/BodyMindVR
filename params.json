We have created a simple scene in which the player control the intensity of a campfire with his breathing, which is included in the project. We will also show you how to make your own respiratory belt from scratch. \r\n\r\n### How to\r\nFor your sensors to communicate with Unity3D, you will need an OpenBCI or an Arduino REV3 board.\r\nWe used OpenBCI board with Openvibe (version 1.0.1) but it should work the same with an Arduino board. \r\nYou can download OpenVibe here: http://openvibe.inria.fr/pub/bin/win32/ \r\nYou will also need Python 2.7.10 (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the superpackage \"numpy\" (http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.10.1/) installed on your machine. You have to install numpy through the terminal cmd. \r\nDownload the project BodyMindVR.\r\nInstall Oculus Rift Runtime 0.6.0.2 on your machine.\r\nLaunch \"openvibe-acquisition-server\" (located at C:Program Files/Openvibe).\r\nSelect Driver \"OpenBCI (unstable), Connection Port: \"1024\", Sample Count: \"32\", and click on \"Driver Properties\".\r\nMake sure your OpenBCI or Arduino board is connected to the matching port //./COM3 or //./COM4.\r\nOn the \"Send Command on Init\", set the line to: \"x1060000Xx2060000X\" and Click \"Apply\".\r\nBack on the OpenViBE Acquisition Server, Click on \"Connect\".\r\nLaunch \"openvibe-designer\" (located at C:Program Files/Openvibe).\r\nClick \"File\", \"Open\". Open the file \"hackathon_coherence_openbci_manual\" located in the \"Neurovr\" master folder.\r\nClick the icon \"Play\". If the sensors are ready, you should see some movement already on your screen. \r\nLaunch Unity3D (version 5.1.1f1) and open \"Breathe@work\" folder.\r\nIn Unity 3D, open the scene \"test-oclus\". \r\nThat's it! You made it! You can now help to improve this project!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nInitiated in Montreal, November 2015, by Jérémy Frey (@jfrey-phd), Alexandre Girardeau (@alecz1k), Kevin Ouellet (@kouellet), Sandy Carter (@bwrsandman), Bertrand Nepveu, Karl-Antoine Simoneau, Léa Charpentier, Aphisith Keosavang. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor any inquiries, contact us @alecz1k, @jfrey-phd, @kouellet.\r\n\r\nMore info will follow","google":"vr, eeg, openbci, ecg, neurotech, neurotechmtl, respiratory belt, oculus, rift, biofeedback, neurofeedback, bodymindvr, vrvana, highway101, ","note":"Don't delete this file!
